# Random cat pics

## Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It fetches random cat pics from [here](https://thatcopy.pw/catapi/rest/). New pic is shown with every hit of the refresh button. I used useState and useEffect hooks in this project.
